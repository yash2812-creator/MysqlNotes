SELECT USER(); --> through which login connected	

SELECT DATABASE(); --> through which database connected currently
 
USE MYDB0; ---> to connect database
 
SHOW TABLES; --> shows available tables 

SQL COMMANDS PART1 (DQL)
-------------------------
* ---> display all columns 

SELECT * FROM table_name; ---> to print tables

DESC table_name  ---> structure of tables (column names and other details)

SELECT COLUMN1, COLUMN2 FROM TABLE_NAME;

SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE 4 > 90 ---> not error no records shown cause condition is false

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME <> 'SMITH'; ---> display table except smith
            OR
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME != 'SMITH'; 

LOGICAL AND OR OPERATORS
-----------------------

SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME 
WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' AND SAL < 1000;

SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME 
WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' OR SAL < 1000;

SELECT * FROM EMP 
WHERE (JOB = 'MANAGER' OR JOB = 'CLERK') AND SAL<1000; --> Parenthisis has more priority while running query

SQL SPECIAL OPERATORS
---------------------

1)BETWEEN : it works with range of values

 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1250 AND 3000; ---->both values are inclusive
 
 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME BETWEEN 'ADAMS' AND 'SMITH'; --->range between first later of condition
 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL NOT BETWEEN 1250 AND 3000;
 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME NOT BETWEEN 'ADAMS' AND 'SMITH';
 
 2) IN : useful for equating multiple values of a single column it acts as logical or operator'
 
  SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB IN ('CLERK','MANAGER');  ---> in convert query into or
  SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB NOT IN ('CLERK','MANAGER'); 
  SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB NOT IN ('CLERK','MANAGER',NULL); ---> in means it convert query into and
  SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL NOT IN (1250,9999); ---> everything will print except salary 1250 and 9999.
  
 3) IS NULL : to see the null value records or missing or blank value records

   SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NULL;
   
4) LIKE : it is a pattern matching operator. it will not search for an "exact value".
          #there are two wild cards associated with LIKE operator.
		    a) % -> it will replace any character and any number of characters.
                    it replaces zero or one or multiple characters.		

                     SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%';	
					 
			b)_  ->  a single underscore replaces single character. so to replace
			         certain number of
					 
					 SELECT * FROM PCODES WHERE CODE LIKE '__01';
					 
					 
5)	ESACPE:
		SELECT * FROM PCODES WHERE CODE LIKE 'A?%C01' ESCAPE '?';
		SELECT * FROM PCODES WHERE CODE NOT LIKE 'A?%C01' ESCAPE '?';
	
6)
     COLUMN ALIASES ---> only in the output of select statement the column will have a different cutomized 
							heading
	 SELECT ENAME, SAL AS SALARY FROM EMP; ---> As is optional keyword
	 SELECT ENAME 'NAME OF EMPLOYEE' ,SAL SALARY FROM EMP;
					 
ORDER BY CLAUSE:
----------------
	 SELECT * FROM EMP ORDER BY ENAME DESC; ---> Asc -ascending
	 PRECEDENCE RULE ---> NULL ,NEGATIVE VALUE , 0 , POSITIVE 
     
	 #first position in query having first priority in ORDERBY clause.
      SELECT ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP ORDER BY 2;
